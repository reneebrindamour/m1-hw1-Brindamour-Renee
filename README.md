## About Me
My name is Renee Brindamour, and I am a Mom, Student, and Web Designer for the University of Michigan. Deciding to pursue my Master's degree was based on two things. My father passed away in January. I promised him that I would reach for the stars, be happy, and pursue the things that interests me. Studying web design and working in the field is more of a hobby for me. I love what I study, love my work, and love to learn new things. 

## Past Coding Experience
I have experience in Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and basic level JavaScript. Using GIT, GITHUB, and VS is new to me. I have always used Dreamweaver and never needed GIT or GITHUB in my past studies or work environment.

## Career Goals
1. Become proficient in coding language used in web design and development
2. Pursue postions in the world of design that pays more.
3. Start up my own web design and development company that I can do on the side initially but move to a more independent lifestyle and being my own boss.
4. Gain expertise artificial intelligence.
