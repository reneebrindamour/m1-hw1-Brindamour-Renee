## About Me
My name is Renee Brindamour. I live in the Ann Arbor, Michigan area. I am a Mom, Student, and full-time Web Designer for the University of Michigan. I graduated from Southern New Hampshire University in 2023 with a Bachelor's of Arts degree in Graphic Design with a concentration in Web Design. Deciding to pursue my Master's degree was based on two things: 1. My father passed away in January after a five-year fight with stage 4 lung cancer. He was a non smoker and my best friend. In his honor, I promised him that I would reach for the stars, pursue happiness, and seek out the things that interests me. 2. Studying web design and working in the field is more of a hobby for me. I love what I study, love my work, and love to learn new things. This has brought me to the University of Florida where I'm excited to expand on my previous education and experience. My picture represents a woman who is carefree in her environment. I often seek out nature to rejuvenate my soul and find clarity. Therefore, this picture spoke to me.

## Past Coding Experience
I have experience in Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and basic level JavaScript. Using GIT, GITHUB, and VS is new to me. I have always used Dreamweaver and never needed GIT or GITHUB in my past studies or work environment. Therefore, this will be a learning curve.

## Career Goals
1. Become proficient in coding language used in web design and development
2. Pursue postions in the world of design that pays more.
3. Start up my own web design and development company that I can do on the side initially but move to a more independent lifestyle and being my own boss.
4. Gain expertise artificial intelligence.
